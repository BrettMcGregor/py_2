# py_2

code written during completion of Udemy 'Intro to Flask' course.

Developed a simple guestbook web app which connected to a local MySQL database for storage and retrieval of user input data.

Also this project was my first successful use of a virtual environment using Python27.

Instructions:
1. Ensure MySQL server service is running
2. Run guestbook.py
3. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in browser
